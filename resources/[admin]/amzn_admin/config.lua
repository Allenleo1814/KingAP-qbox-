--- 919 ADMIN SERVER CONFIGURATION
---
--- Please note that there are not many options for the server config,
--- this is because the resource is designed to be plug-and-play as much
--- as possible. All permissions and configurable options are inside the
--- admin menu itself, which is accessed in-game.
---
--- Frameworks and third-party resource integration is designed with
--- an auto-detect feature to make installing and running 919ADMIN
--- as painless as possible.

    --- Disable Reports
    --- This is used to disable the reports system.
    --- If you want to disable the reports system, set this to true.
    --- This will only disable the /report command however, the reports menu will still be accessible.

    --- Disable IP Display
    --- When true, IP addresses are not shown in the admin menu identifiers

            --- Then copy the API key and paste it here.

        --- Discord Webhooks
        --- This is used to log player actions, quick actions, and screenshots to a Discord webhook.
        --- You can get the webhook url by creating a new channel, and then
        --- creating a webhook in the channel settings under the "Integrations" tab.
        --- Then copy the url and paste it here.

    --- Discord Role Permissions
    --- This is used to add a player to a 919ADMIN User Group based on their Discord Role.
    --- This is optional and not required for the resource to work.
    --- If you want to use this feature, you must have a bot in your Discord server.
    --- You can get the bot token by going to the Discord Developer Portal and creating a new application.
    --- Then create a bot and copy the token.
    --- You can then add the bot to your server and use the following config.
    DiscordRolePermissions = {
        Enabled = false,
        --- Bot token
        DiscordToken = "",
        --- Server ID 
        GuildID = "",
    
        --- Discord roles you want to map to a 919ADMIN User Group.
        --- ORDER MATTERS: Highest priority first; the first match wins.
        --- Make sure you first create the User Group in the 919ADMIN menu, and use the exact name.
        --- It is case-sensitive. Also make sure your role ids are strings.
        --- Example:
        --- DiscordRoles = {
        ---     { role = "123456789012345678", group = "SuperAdmin" },
        ---     { role = "234567890123456789", group = "Admin" },
        ---     { role = "345678901234567890", group = "Moderator" },
        --- }
        DiscordRoles = {
            { role = "", group = "SuperAdmin" },
            -- { role = "DiscordRoleId", group = "PanelGroupName" },
        },
