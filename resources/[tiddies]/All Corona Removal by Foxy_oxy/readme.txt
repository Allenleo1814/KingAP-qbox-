I Reuploaded the File Because People were having problems compatibility problems with other graphic mods . so please kindly only use the manual installation method so that the graphics mods don't break .

also i decrease the resolution of the file from 256x256 to 4x4 ( this would boost performance on older CPUs , giving you a little bit of more FPS ).




Simple Install !! ( Recommended only for people who don't use any graphics mods)

1) Drag and drop the graphics.ytd file into mods/update/update.rpf/x64/textures 

2) Done !



!!! Manual Install ( Recommended for GRAPHICS MODS )

1)go to mods/update/update.rpf/64/textures

2)open graphics.ytd and drag corona.dds into the graphics.ytd 

3) hit save .
